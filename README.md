Ionic-Cli
=========

The Ionic Framework command line utility makes it easy to start, build, run, and emulate [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) apps. In the future, it will also have support for our mobile development services and tools that make Ionic even more powerful.

## Installing

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

## Starting an Ionic App

```bash
$ ionic start myApp
```

## Adding a platform target

```bash
$ ionic platform ios android
```

## Building your app

```bash
$ ionic build ios
```

## Emulating your app

```bash
$ ionic emulate ios
```

## Running your app

```bash
$ ionic run ios
```

Ionic uses Cordova underneath, so you can also substitute Cordova commands to prepare/build/emulate/run, or to add additional plugins.

Note: we occasionally anonymous usage statistics to the Ionic team to make the tool better.
