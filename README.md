The Ionic command line interface (CLI) is your go-to tool for developing
[Ionic][ionic-homepage] apps.

We have several branches for CLI versions:

* [`master`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) (alpha): `npm install
  -g ionic@canary`
* [`3.x`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/tree/3.x) (stable): `npm
  install -g ionic` *(recommended)*
* [`2.x`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/tree/2.x) (legacy): `npm
  install -g ionic@legacy`
