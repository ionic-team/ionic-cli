# Ionic CLI

The Ionic command line interface (CLI) is your go-to tool for developing
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) apps.

Use the `ionic help` command for more detailed task information.

Page](http://ionicframework.com/support) for general support questions. The

[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/blob/v3/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements

* Node 6+
* npm 3+

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
```

:memo: *Note: For a global install of `-g ionic`, OSX/Linux users may need to prefix
the command with `sudo` or can setup [proper file permissions on OSX for
npm](http://www.johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/) to
install without `sudo`.*

## Changes from CLI 2

We have rewritten the CLI from the ground up.  Our main focus was to:

1. Decrease the amount of time to the first **start** execution
1. Improve the responsiveness of every CLI command
1. Make the architecture flexible for future platform support (PWA, electron, etc.)
1. Provide better **help**, more guidance, and more feedback when executing commands.

In doing so we decided to take a new approach to the CLI's structure. The base
CLI installation now ships with global commands that are common to all Ionic
apps.

Cordova commands have been namespaced and put into a CLI _plugin_, which is
installed by default with new Ionic projects and can be installed in existing
Ionic projects with `npm i --save @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova`. For full details,
see below.

Here is a brief summary of changes in CLI 3. For more details and reasoning,
see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/blob/v3/CHANGELOG.md).

* Removed commands: `setup`, `share`, `lib`, `io`, `security`, `push`,
  `config`, `service`, `add`, `remove`, `list`, `hooks`, `state`.
* Added commands: `signup`.
* Cordova commands have been namespaced (e.g. `ionic cordova build`, not `ionic
  build`).
* Many command arguments, options, and flags have changed. Please use `ionic
  help <commands>` for command usage.
* `generate` command has been overhauled to interactively generate components,
  pages, etc. Going forward, generators will continue to be improved.

```

## Ionic Angular

#### Start a new project
```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
$ ionic start myNewProject
$ cd ./myNewProject
$ ionic serve
```

#### Existing project

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
$ npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic-angular@beta @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova@beta
$ ionic help
```

## Ionic 1

#### Start a new project

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
$ ionic start myNewProject blank --type ionic1
$ cd ./myNewProject
$ ionic serve
```

#### Existing project

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@beta
$ npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic1@beta @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova@beta
$ ionic help
```

## Using Cordova

Integrate Ionic with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) to bring native
capabilities to your app.

### Requirements

* For iOS development (macOS required), see the [iOS Platform
  Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html).
* For Android development, see the [Android Platform
  Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html).

```bash
$ npm install -g cordova
$ npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova@beta
$ ionic cordova --help
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

## Service Proxies

The `serve` command can add some proxies to the http server. These proxies are
useful if you are developing in the browser and you need to make calls to an
external API. With this feature you can proxy request to the external api
through the ionic http server preventing the `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
header is present on the requested resource` error.

In the `ionic.config.json` file you can add a property with an array of proxies
you want to add. The proxies are object with the following properties:

* `path`: string that will be matched against the beginning of the incoming
  request URL.
* `proxyUrl`: a string with the url of where the proxied request should go.
* `proxyNoAgent`: (optional) true/false, if true opts out of connection
  pooling, see
  [HttpAgent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)

```json
{
  "name": "appname",
  "email": "",
  "app_id": "",
  "proxies": [
    {
      "path": "/v1",
      "proxyUrl": "https://api.instagram.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}

```

Using the above configuration, you can now make requests to your local server
at `http://localhost:8100/v1` to have it proxy out requests to
`https://api.instagram.com/v1`

## Using a Proxy

To proxy CLI requests, you will first need to install a CLI plugin:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-proxy
```

Then, set any of the following environment variables:

```bash
$ export http_proxy=http://internal.proxy.com
$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://internal.proxy.com
$ export PROXY=http://internal.proxy.com
$ export IONIC_HTTP_PROXY=http://internal.proxy.com
```

For example:

```bash
$ HTTP_PROXY=http://internal.proxy.com ionic login
```
