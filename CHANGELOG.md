* Added in the `ionic state` command to help organize your Cordova platforms and plugins by storing the information in the package.json file. Try out `ionic state save` and `ionic state restore`.
* Added in the `ionic hooks` command to help users deal with the default Ionic hooks. In 1.3.18, they were removed by default. That has been turned off, and now to opt-out, use `ionic hooks remove`, or to add back in `ionic hooks add`.
* Added in `--noresources` option for `ionic platform add` - to avoid getting the default Ionic resources.
* Updated default Crosswalk version to 12.41.296.5.

* The serve command now allows you to specify a path to start the browser in so you can go straight to what you want to test - `ionic serve -o /#/tab/dash`
* The serve command now checks for existing server and live reload ports before trying to start up servers. If either serve host/port is used, then the port is incremented and informs the user of the change, then starts the server to avoid Address conflicts.
* There was a bug when multiple addresses were available - it gave the option to select the address but immediately started listening to console commands for the server. This has been corrected, and now correctly prompts for the address.
* The serve command proxy now accepts another property `proxyNoAgent`: (optional) true/false, if true opts out of connection pooling, see [HttpAgent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)
* Added in the `proxyNoAgent` property on `ionic.project` proxies to be true/false, if true opts out of connection pooling, see [HttpAgent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)
